// poolWakeReadiness answers, per store, the question the SERVE side answers for
// an orphaned assigned row: would the query a freshly woken seat runs actually
// be served this bead?
//
// The wake-known-identity tier mints a seat for assigned work whose claimant
// session is gone. That seat's own reader for an open row is the assigned-ready
// tier — `bd ready --assignee="$id"` (internal/config/workquery.go,
// assignedReadyTierCommand) — so a row bd ready refuses is a row the seat can
// never claim. The controller cannot run that query per row, and Bead.Status
// cannot stand in for it: mapBdStatus collapses bd's blocked, deferred, review
// and testing statuses onto "open", so the status gate in
// computePoolDesiredStatesAt passes every one of them and the row is capacity
// demand forever.
//
// Counting rows the serve path is structurally forbidden to hand out is the
// protocol mismatch config.PoolDemandServeRules was introduced to close for the
// UNASSIGNED arm. This is that same correspondence for the assigned arm, read
// off the Ready() snapshot the demand phase already takes once per store
// (readyDemandCache) rather than a second hand-written opinion about what
// "ready" means.

// the frontier was asked the same question the serving seat will ask, so every
// row the verdict cannot speak for answers false and keeps the demand it had
// before this gate existed:
//
//   - a live claimant's row belongs to the RESUME tier, whose job is to keep
//     that session alive whether or not the work is ready this instant;
//   - a non-open row is served by the crash-recovery list read, not bd ready;
//   - a row whose type or labels Ready() structurally EXCLUDES was never a
//     candidate, so its absence means "not eligible for this query", not
//     "blocked". An assigned molecule/wisp root is exactly that case — the
//     census admits it as genuine demand on purpose because "an assigned
//     root-only wisp is the executable turn"
//     (appendOpenAssignedMoleculeWorkUnique), and the legacy assigned-ready
//     probe serves it through `bd query` with a selector that excludes epics
//     and nothing else (config.ephemeralAssignedReadyProbeScript);
//   - a target template with its own work_query has replaced the default
//     assigned-ready tier verbatim (config.Agent.effectiveQuery), so the
//     predicate this gate mirrors is not the one that seat will run.
//
// A deferral is not this gate's question. The caller's IsDeferred filter
// (#5094) has already dropped every row hidden right now, and the seat is
// served a row whose defer_until has elapsed: `bd ready` keeps
// `defer_until IS NULL OR defer_until <= UTC_TIMESTAMP()` after its wake sweep
// reopens an elapsed dated defer, the federated `gc ready` applies IsDeferred
// through Ready(), and gc hook drops only a future defer_until
// (isFutureDeferredHookCandidate).
